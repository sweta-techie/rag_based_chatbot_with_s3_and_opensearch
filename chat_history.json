It involves 3 major steps 1. Loss Calculation 2. Backward pass 3. Weight updates     Before we dive deep into these steps, let us now structure a very simple neural network with 1 hidden layerswipe rightswipe right     FORWARD PASS Let's first pass the inputs through the network and calculate the output     1. Computing Hidden Layer Activation: Each input is multiplied with the weight associated with each neuron and summed. The activation function ( ) is applied to it.     Using this equation we get h1 and h2     2. Computing Output:     y_pred is the final output of the neural networkswipe right     LOSS CALCULATION Let's consider Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function     L is the loss value y_pred is the output of neural net y_true is the ground truth for that input     Our goal is to minimize this loss valueswipe right     GRADIENT DESCENT     Weight Update:     For every weight in the NN, the new weight should be calculated.     We move in the opposite direction of change in loss, hence the subtraction      is the learning rate to control the change.",

A guide for transferring tokens from a source chain (where tokens are sent from) to a destination chain (where tokens are sent to) is provided below.\n### Terra Bridge\n**Terra Bridge** is a web interface created specifically for interchain transfers. When a interchain transfer is requested, Terra Bridge will generate a transaction in the appropriate format that encodes the necessary data required for the transfer.\n#### 1. Connect Terra Bridge With A User-Owned Account\nIn order to sign transactions created through Terra Bridge, users must have the relevant software installed for connecting the Terra Bridge WebApp with the user-owned account on the source chain. This can be achieved via wallet extensions or services that enable wallet-to-application connections.\nSupported wallet extensions / services and their installation links are:\n| | |\n| - | - |\n| Network | Extension |\n| Terra | Terra Station Extension |\n| Ethereum | Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/), [Coinbase Wallet |\n| BSC | Binance Chain Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/binance-chain-wallet/fhbohimaelbohpjbbldcngcnapndodjp?hl=en), [Metamask |\n#### 2. Specify Transfer Details\nBefore making the transfer, the details of the transfer should be specified by the user. The transfer details include:\n* **Asset**\\: the asset type to transfer.\n* **From**\\: source chain to make transfer from. Users must have an asset balance on this chain.\n* **To**\\: destination chain to receive transfer.\n* **Amount**\\: asset amount to transfer.\n* **Destination**\\: account address to receive transferred tokens.\n#### 3. Confirm Transfer Details\nConfirm transfer details displayed on the WebApp and select **\\[Confirm\\]** to proceed.\nShuttle applies a fee of **0.1%** (with a minimum 1 UST fee) for Terra to Ethereum transfers. Transfer requests below a transfer value of 1 UST are ignored.\n#### 4. Sign and Broadcast the Transaction\nConfirm transaction details and click **\\[Confirm\\]** to sign and broadcast a transaction that encodes the interchain transfer request. Note that this request may be made from a different extension / service depending on the selected source blockchain.\n#### 5. Transfer Request Complete\nA popup will show to display the details of the interchain transfer.\nThe Shuttle bridge waits for sufficient blockchain confirmations to occur on the source chain before making the transfer. It may take up to a few minutes for transferred token to be reflected on the destination chain.\n### \n### Terra Station\nInterchain transfers from Terra to Ethereum / BSC are also supported on **Terra Station**. Interchain token transfers through Terra Station can be achieved by following the below steps.\n#### 1. Select an Asset to Transfer\nSelect an asset to transfer and click **\\[Send\\]**.\n#### 2. Specify Transfer Details\nUsers should specify the transfer details listed below:\n* **Network**\\: destination chain to receive transfer.\n* **Send to**\\: account address to receive transferred tokens.\n* **Amount**\\: asset amount to transfer.\nClick **\\[Next\\]** after all details have been filled.\n#### 3. Confirm Transfer Details\nConfirm transaction details, fill in the password and click **\\[Send\\]** to sign and broadcast a transaction that encodes the interchain transfer request.\nShuttle applies a fee of **0.1%** (with a minimum 1 UST fee) for Terra to Ethereum transfers. Transfer requests below a transfer value of 1 UST are ignored.\n#### 4. Transfer Request Complete\nA popup will show to display the details of the interchain transfer.\nThe Shuttle bridge waits for sufficient blockchain confirmations to occur on the source chain before making the transfer. It may take up to a few minutes for transferred token to be reflected on the destination chain.\nPreviousText Proposal NextWebApp \nLast updated 2 years ago\nOn this page\n* Token Contract Addresses\n* Luna\n* Terra USD\n* Anchor Token (ANC)\n* User Interfaces / Usage\n* Terra Bridge\n* \n* Terra Station\nWas this helpful?\n",
